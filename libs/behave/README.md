Behave uses tests written in a natural language style, backed up by Python code.

Behavior-driven development (or BDD) is an agile software development technique that encourages collaboration between developers, QA and non-technical or business participants in a software project.

Behave allows business/non-technical people/QA to write high level requirements as test scenarios using natural language like english, and then developers write code that release those scenarios.

Behave can be used as acceptance testing tool.
